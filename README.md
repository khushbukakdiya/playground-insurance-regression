# Kaggle Playground Series S4E12 – Insurance Cost Prediction

This project was developed for Kaggle's Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 12: [Regression with an Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e12/overview).

The objective was to predict individual insurance charges based on features like age, sex, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region.
